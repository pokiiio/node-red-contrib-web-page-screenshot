## Install 

```
cd ~/.node-red
npm install node-red-contrib-web-page-screenshot
```

## Usage

 - If this node is triggered, this node will take a screenshot of the configured web page in setting screen. 
 - This node takes a screenshot as PNG image, and encodes with base64.
 - The base64 string will be returned.

## Settings

In setting menu, there are some items like below.

### Name (Optional)

You can set any name to the node. Blank is allowed.

### Web Page URL (Optional)

URL which you want to take a screenshot. If blank, this node will take a screenshot of http://example.com .

### executablePath (Optional)

You can specify chromium/chrome executable with the path. For those who use x86 arch, this can be blank, however, if you use this node on ARM arch (e.g. Raspberry Pi), you have to install headless-mode-available `chromium-browser` and set the path.

> Fortunately, [Raspbian OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (as of ver. April 2019) includes compatible `chromium-browser`, so just set `/usr/bin/chromium-browser` to this blank.

### Wait Until

You can set the event to wait for before taking a screen shot.

- _Load_ - consider navigation to be finished when the `load` event is fired.
- _DOM Content Loaded_ - consider navigation to be finished when the `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired.
- _No more than 0 Network Connections for 500ms_ - consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 0 network connections for at least 500 ms.
- _No more than 2 Network Connections for 500m_ - consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 2 network connections for at least 500 ms.
- _Fixed Delay_ - consider navigation to be finished when timer has elapsed and the `load` devent is fired. Timer value set in the settings in milliseconds. Maximum of 30s.

### [UPDATED]

Add Wait Until setting

### [UPDATED] Class Name (only in `screenshot-class` node)

For partial screenshots, you can specify a class name of element you want to take screenshots. If blank, a whole screenshot will be taken.

### [UPDATED] ID Name (only in `screenshot-id` node)

For partial screenshots, you can specify a ID name of element you want to take screenshots. If blank, a whole screenshot will be taken.


## Example


This flow provides a web page with a screenshot of a configured URL.

```


A point is, in HTML string of HTTP response, the base64 string is included like following.


```html
<html><body><img src=\"data:image/png;base64,{{payload}}\"></body></html>
```


If you access the endpoint...
